  ## Description
  Just A Little Note takes input from the user to create a list of notes to reference. You can add as many notes as you'd like, then delete notes to keep your list of notes clean. This application uses JavaScript with HTML and CSS on the frontend, with server integration with express.js and node.js on the backend.
